                <h1>The History</h1>
                <p>
                    The state legislature established Salt Lake Community College in
                    1947 as a state-supported vocational school under the management and
                    control of the Utah State Board for Vocational Education. Classes
                    began in the fall of 1948. In 1978 it became part of the Utah System
                    of Higher Education under the jurisdiction of the Utah State Board
                    of Regents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently it is the state's largest two-year college with the most
                    diverse student body. It serves more than 60,000 students on 10
                    campuses as well as through online classes.
